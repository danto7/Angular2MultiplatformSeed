# Angular2MultiplatformSeed
Angular2MultiplatformSeed is my approach to simply start a project without crushing my head on gulp build tasks and other annoying and repetitive things.

## TODO
* replace jade with pug
* implement electron
* implement taco
* implement nodejs build task with restify
* implement docs generation with typedoc
